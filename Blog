    <h2>Least Favorite Manga's</h2>
    <p>Now Now before you crucify me it doesn't mean the manga is bad just that I don't prefer it compared to others,Number 1 goes to Naruto only because I've never been a fan ninjas or shinobi's just not my style,Number 2 being any isekai besides ReZero I feel like isekai's have been overused to where its not as interesting and Number 3 being Fire Force I just can't into Fire boy that's fast. </p>
